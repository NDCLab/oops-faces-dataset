### Psychopy Experiment Materials

This folder has everything you need to run this experiment! (Psychopy v2022.2.4)

Feel free to contact Emily (ylimerm3) via Github or [E-mail](Mailto:emart459@fiu.edu) if you have any questions.

NOTE: You will need to comment out the EEG port / markers code to run without EEG. You will also need to install [Makehuman (v1.2.0)](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/makehuman_120.html) and [FaReT](https://github.com/fsotoc/FaReT) in order to run the experiment.
Then, open a "Socket Render" (under Rendering in Makehuman) *before* you start the Psychopy experiment.
